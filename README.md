Bank Account Management System
This is a simple Bank Account Management System implemented in Python. It allows users to create a bank account, perform deposits, withdrawals, and check the current balance. The system is designed with two classes: BankAccount and Menu.

BankAccount Class
The BankAccount class represents a bank account and includes the following methods:

__init__(self, account_holder_name, account_number, balance=0): Initializes a new bank account with the given account holder name, account number, and an optional initial balance (default is 0).

deposit(self, amount): Deposits a specified amount into the account. Prints the new balance after the deposit.

withdraw(self, amount): Withdraws a specified amount from the account if sufficient funds are available. Prints the new balance after the withdrawal.

display_balance(self): Displays the account holder's name, account number, and current balance.

Menu Class
The Menu class is a simple class that provides a static method show_menu() to display the available options for the user.

Deposit: Deposit a specific amount into the account.
